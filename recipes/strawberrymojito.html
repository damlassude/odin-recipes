    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The mojito is already practically a perfect drink in every way, so what could possibly make it better? A little seasonal fruit, like strawberries! When they reach their peak at the beginning of summer, strawberries are an excellent accompaniment to a mojito's sweet, sour, minty flavor.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>White sugar</li>
            <li>2 large limes</li>
            <li>Mint leaves</li>
            <li>Strawberries</li>
            <li>Club soda</li>
            <li>White rum</li>
            <li>Ice cubes</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour about 1/2 inch of sugar onto a small, shallow plate. Run a lime wedge around the rims of 8 cocktail glasses, then dip the rims into sugar to coat; set aside.</li>
            <li>Squeeze all of the lime wedges into a sturdy glass pitcher. Toss juiced limes into the pitcher along with mint, strawberries, and 1 cup sugar. Crush with a muddler to release strawberry juice and mint oil. Stir in club soda and rum until sugar has dissolved.

            </li>
            <li>Pour into the prepared glasses over ice cubes to serve.</li>
        </ol>
